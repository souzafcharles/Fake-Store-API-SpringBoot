# Java Backend Challenge - FakeStore API Integration

---

## 1. Business Problem Solved

This backend system integrates with the **FakeStore API** to manage **Products, Users, Carts, and CartProducts**.  
The focus is on **Products**, which are the core of the e-commerce domain. The application does more than CRUD: it provides **aggregations, analytics, and search features** that make the system useful for real business cases.

Examples of value-added functionalities:
- Search products by **keyword** across title and description.
- Get the **Top N most expensive** or **Top N cheapest** products.
- Calculate **average product price per category**.
- Filter products by **price range**.
- Track **most sold products** and calculate **revenue per product** based on carts.
- Count **total products per user cart** and filter carts by **total value**.
- Guarantee **data consistency** when linking products, users, and carts.

This addresses the challenge of turning a **simple external API** into a **functional e-commerce intelligence backend** that could be directly consumed by a frontend application or analytics dashboard.

### Fake Store API Model Entity:

![Fake Store API Entity](https://github.com/souzafcharles/Fake-Store-API-SpringBoot/blob/main/src/main/resources/static/img/entities.png)

#### Relationships:

1. **User → Cart**: One user can have multiple carts (`1:N`).
2. **Cart → CartProduct**: Each cart can contain multiple products (`1:N`), represented by `CartProduct`.
3. **Product → CartProduct**: Each product can appear in multiple carts (`1:N`), represented by `CartProduct`.
4. **CartProduct** is a **join entity** to handle the many-to-many relationship between `Cart` and `Product`, with additional attribute `quantity`.

## 3. Architecture & Design Patterns

The application follows a **Layered Architecture**:  
`Controller → Service → Repository → Database/External API`.

- **Controller Layer**: Exposes REST endpoints, handles request validation, and orchestrates responses.
- **Service Layer**: Implements all business logic, enforces domain rules, and coordinates interactions between repositories and external APIs.
- **Repository Layer**: Abstracts data persistence using **Spring Data JPA** for local H2 database storage.
- **Database (H2)**: Stores local entities for testing, offline usage, and as a cache layer to reduce dependency on external APIs.
- **External API Client**: Consumes **FakeStore API** via **WebClient**, encapsulating all external HTTP calls in a dedicated client class (`FakeStoreClient`).

**Design Patterns applied:**
- **Repository Pattern**: Centralizes all persistence logic and abstracts database interactions.
- **DTO Pattern**: Separates internal domain entities from external API contracts, enforcing clear boundaries between request/response payloads and internal models.
- **Exception Handling**: Centralized custom exceptions (`ResourceNotFoundException`, `DuplicateEmailException`, `DatabaseException`) with a unified error response (`StandardError`) to ensure consistent API error reporting.
- **Factory / Data Initializer**: Seeds local database at startup using data from FakeStore API, ensuring baseline data availability for development and testing.
- **Centralized Messages Utility**: Manages all system messages (logs, validation messages, Swagger descriptions, exception messages) in a single utility class (`Messages`), reducing duplication and preparing for future **i18n** support.

### Project Logic Layered Architecture:

![Layered Architecture](https://github.com/souzafcharles/Fake-Store-API-SpringBoot/blob/main/src/main/resources/static/img/logical-layers.png)


**Justification:**  
A **Layered Architecture** was chosen for its clarity and suitability, ensuring maintainability and readability while fulfilling the challenge requirements.

---

## 4. Algorithms & Business Logic (Method Explanations)

Below is a detailed explanation of the most important methods across services.

### 🔹 ProductService
Handles **all product-related logic**.
- `getAllProducts(Pageable pageable)`: Returns a paginated list of all products.
- `getProductById(String id)`: Finds a product by its ID or throws `ResourceNotFoundException`.
- `createProduct(ProductRequestDTO dto)`: Creates a new product from request data.
- `updateProduct(String id, ProductRequestDTO dto)`: Updates fields of an existing product.
- `deleteProduct(String id)`: Deletes a product safely.
- `searchProducts(String keyword)`: Searches products by title or description (case-insensitive).
- `getTopExpensiveProducts(int topN)`: Returns the top N most expensive products.
- `getTopCheapestProducts(int topN)`: Returns the top N cheapest products.
- `getAveragePricePerCategory()`: Calculates the average price per category.
- `getProductsByPriceRange(Double min, Double max)`: Finds products within a given price range.

---

### 🔹 CartService
Handles **shopping cart management**.
- `getAllCarts(Pageable pageable)`: Lists carts with pagination.
- `getCartById(String id)`: Retrieves a cart by its ID.
- `createCart(CartRequestDTO dto)`: Creates a cart linked to a valid user and products.
- `updateCart(String id, CartRequestDTO dto)`: Updates user and products inside an existing cart.
- `deleteCart(String id)`: Removes a cart, handling integrity issues.
- `getCartsByUserId(String userId)`: Gets all carts belonging to a specific user.
- `getTotalProductsForUser(String userId)`: Counts all products (sum of quantities) in a user’s carts.
- `getCartsWithTotalValueGreaterThan(Double minTotal)`: Returns carts whose total value exceeds a threshold.

---

### 🔹 UserService
Manages **user accounts and validations**.
- `getAllUsers(Pageable pageable)`: Returns a paginated list of users.
- `getUserById(String id)`: Retrieves a user by ID.
- `createUser(UserRequestDTO dto)`: Creates a new user with **email duplication check**.
- `updateUser(String id, UserRequestDTO dto)`: Updates user data, validating unique email.
- `deleteUser(String id)`: Deletes a user with exception handling.
- `getUserByUsername(String username)`: Finds a user by username.
- `getUserByEmail(String email)`: Finds a user by email.
- `searchUsersByUsername(String keyword)`: Searches users by partial username match.
- `countUsers()`: Counts all registered users.

---

### 🔹 CartProductService
Handles **products inside carts**.
- `addProductToCart(String cartId, CartProductRequestDTO dto)`: Adds a product to a cart; if already present, increases its quantity.
- `deleteProductFromCart(String cartId, String productId)`: Removes a product from a cart.
- `getProductsInCart(String cartId)`: Lists all products inside a given cart.
- `getMostSoldProducts(int topN)`: Returns the top N most sold products by total quantity.
- `getRevenuePerProduct()`: Calculates total revenue generated per product.
- `getTotalItemsInCarts()`: Returns the global count of all items in all carts.
- `getCartsContainingProduct(String productId)`: Finds all carts that contain a specific product.

---

## 5. Technical Decisions & Trade-offs

- **Spring Boot with WebClient**: Chosen for modern, reactive, non-blocking API calls.
- **WebClientConfig + FakeStoreClient**: The `WebClient` bean configuration was separated into a dedicated class (`WebClientConfig`), while the external API integration logic was encapsulated in `FakeStoreClient`. This separation improves testability, promotes single responsibility, and makes it easier to swap or extend external API providers.
- **H2 Database**: Enables local development with zero setup; downside is data resets on restart.
- **DTO separation**: Prevents exposing internal entity models directly to API consumers. Both **request and response DTOs** are defined for **Product, User, and Cart** to enforce clear contracts between API and domain layers.
- **Data Initializers**: Each domain (**Product, User, Cart**) includes a `DataInitializer` that loads data from the external **FakeStore API** at startup when the local repository is empty. This ensures baseline data availability for development and testing, while accepting the trade-off of external dependency during initialization.
- **Centralized Exception Handling**: A dedicated package consolidates custom exceptions (`ResourceNotFoundException`, `DuplicateEmailException`, `DatabaseException`) and a unified error response model (`StandardError`) through `ResourceExceptionHandler`. This approach ensures consistent, descriptive, and user-friendly error messages across the entire API.
- **Centralized Messages Utility**: All system messages (logs, validation, Swagger descriptions, and exception messages) are managed in a single utility class (`Messages`). This reduces code duplication, keeps controllers/services cleaner, and prepares the project for future **internationalization (i18n)**.
- **Layered Package Structure by Responsibility**:
    - **client** → integration with external APIs (`FakeStoreClient`)
    - **config** → bean and application configuration (`WebClientConfig`)
    - **endpoint** → domain logic and REST controllers, organized by module (`cart`, `cartproduct`, `product`, `user`)
    - **exceptions** → centralized exception classes, handlers, and error models
    - **utils** → shared utilities, such as centralized messages
      This organization enforces **single responsibility per package**, improves **readability**, and facilitates **maintenance and testing**.
- **HATEOAS + Pagination**: The API uses **HATEOAS-compliant responses** with `_links` and `_embedded` elements, enabling discoverability of related resources. Pagination is implemented in all list endpoints, providing `page`, `size`, `totalElements`, `totalPages`, and navigation links (`first`, `self`, `next`, `last`). This ensures scalability and consistency when dealing with large datasets.
- **Layered Architecture**: Better for project readability.
- **AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) Testing Pattern**: Adopted for all unit tests to enforce readability, maintain consistency, and clearly separate test setup, execution, and validation.
---

## 6. Testing Strategy

The project adopts a structured **unit testing strategy** using **JUnit 5** and **Mockito** to ensure reliable, maintainable, and predictable behavior across all modules.  
Tests are consistently written following the **AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) pattern**, which improves readability and enforces clarity of intent.

### Key Testing Areas

#### Product Domain
- Validation of core business logic (**CRUD operations**, search, filtering by price range).
- Calculation of top **expensive** and **cheapest** products.
- Aggregation metrics such as **average price per category**.

#### Cart Domain
- Validation of cart aggregation logic, including **total price calculation** and **threshold validations**.
- Ensures correct handling of **empty carts** and **invalid product references**.

#### User Domain
- Validation of user lifecycle operations (**create, update, delete, retrieve**).
- **Duplicate email prevention** and proper exception handling.
- Handling of **not found** scenarios with appropriate error responses.

#### Cross-Cutting Concerns
- Exception handling (`ResourceNotFoundException`, `DuplicateEmailException`, `DatabaseException`).
- Proper translation of exceptions into standardized API error responses.
- Data initialization logic ensuring external API sync runs only when the repository is empty.

### Goals
- **>90% line and branch coverage**, focusing on **business-critical paths** rather than trivial getters/setters.
- Validate both **happy paths** and **failure scenarios** (error propagation, invalid inputs, empty results).
- Ensure **stable and predictable** application behavior under normal and exceptional conditions.
- Provide confidence for future refactoring by covering all **critical use cases** with repeatable, isolated unit tests.

## 9. Conclusion

This project implements a backend system integrating with the **FakeStore API**, addressing all core requirements of the Java Backend Challenge. Beyond simple CRUD operations, it delivers **value-added features** such as product search, top N expensive/cheapest products, price range filtering, average price per category, and cart analytics.

Key achievements:
- **External API Integration** with `WebClient`, encapsulated in `FakeStoreClient` for modularity and testability.
- **Business Logic & Data Processing** to generate actionable insights, including revenue per product and top-selling items.
- **Layered Architecture & Design Patterns** ensuring maintainability, clarity, and scalability.
- **Clean Code & Best Practices** with RESTful APIs, SOLID principles, and full OpenAPI/Swagger documentation.
- **Unit Testing** with JUnit and Mockito, covering critical business paths for reliability.

This solution demonstrates practical problem-solving, technical implementation, and readiness for real-world backend integration and service consumption, fulfilling and exceeding the challenge requirements.
